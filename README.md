# User Accounts

1. Upload CSV functional for columns as follows:

| Email | Name | is Manager | Department | Country | Site Location |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------- |

2. Add single user dialog functional except for the following bugs
   1. Country has to be chosen before site location
   2. Validation only updates after "Add User" is pressed AND a field is updated
   3. Site Location requires its own button and dropdown should exist, not text input
3. Search is functional with minor fixes required
   1. It is case sensitive
   2. Search bar and button UI require update
4. View is function with patches required
   1. Edit User needs all fields changes

Priority:

1. Site Location changes
2. Edit User work
